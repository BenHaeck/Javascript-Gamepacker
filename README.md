# Javascript-Gamepacker

# Takes a bunch of *javascript* files, and *strings*, and stiches them together into an html file, alongside a bunch of boiler plate

---
To use the gamePacker, create a python file, and import the gamePacker file as a module.

Next assign the jsFiles value to a list of the names/paths of your jsFiles (relative to the GamePacker file).

You then generate the html file with the *pack(width, height, name) function*.

The **inDir** value (name/path of the folder of your js code)
**outDir** value (name/path to output the html file).
**assets** (asset html tags).
and **description** (contains the text to put under the canvas).
